# LeetCode
Repo for my LeetCode solutions, editorials, and thoughts.

LeetCode is a marathon, and a thourough understanding of algorithms, their applications, variations on their implementation, language specific syntax (Python for me), and profound clarity on problem solving skills are complete requirements for acing coding interviews and understanding programming in a more initimate sense in general.

My goal for this repo is to add version control and tracking to various topic-wise problems I solve. I want to understand algorithms and data structures in a way where solving coding problems is like speaking natural English.

Here's the format I'm aiming to follow for each LeetCode problem I solve (taken from Duncan Smith's site: https://www.redgreencode.com/leetcode-tip-8-anatomy-of-a-model-solution/)(Changed from third person to first person narrative):

# Problem

Rewrite the problem statement in a way that makes sense to me. LeetCode problem statements aren’t always written in the most understandable way, and even if a problem statement is clear to some readers, it may not be clear to me. So I'll write my own. This section is also a good place to introduce variables I can refer to in the solution.

# Solution

Now that I clearly understand the problem, write the solution itself.

# Intuition

Summarize the key challenges posed by the problem, and the main approach I will use to solve it. When I'm writing the more detailed sections below, make sure they follow the general plan explained in this section. If they don’t, either adjust the details or adjust the plan. I can also use the intuition section to remind yourself how to solve the problem if I forget what approach I used in a future practice session. In this way, it’s a bit like the hints that LeetCode provides for some problems. But while LeetCode authors write hints cryptically, so they don’t give away too much, I should write my intuition section clearly.

# Algorithm ideas

In LeetCode discussion posts, authors often jump to the solution without explaining how they figured it out. The algorithm ideas section is for explaining how I got from the intuition to the final product, including any false starts that can help explain why I solved the problem in the way I did.

# Algorithm

LeetCode problems focus on algorithms and data structures. The algorithm section explains the final algorithm that I used to solve the problem. Usually, I'll want to explain the algorithm using pseudocode. There is no official pseudocode syntax like there is for a programming language, so I'll use whatever form of pseudocode is most understandable to me.

# Algorithm Notes

For some problems, it may not be clear why the algorithm works, even when the explanation is well written. Example cases or test data can help clarify how the algorithm handles different input. This model solution also uses diagrams, which make most model solutions more understandable.

# Code

Finally, I have the actual code, meaning code that LeetCode would accept if I submitted it. If I used code ideas from other sources, this is a good place to link to those in case I want to look them up later. Although LeetCode doesn’t care about code comments, it’s useful to add them to my model code to show where I implement each step of the solution. If there are any remaining questions about what each code block does and why it works, this is the place to clear them up.
